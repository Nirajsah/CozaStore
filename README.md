## Getting Started

This is an E-commerce site build with Next.js 13.4+ and tailwind CSS
All the commits will be done only on main branch.
I will be updating the readme file as the site progresses.

As of Today 21 July, 2023:
most of the work is done, For animation, I am using framer motion(learning).
category page: responsive
product page: responsive
navbar: not responsive
home page: not responsive
cart page does not look good

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
