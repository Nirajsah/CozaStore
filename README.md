## Getting Started

This is a E-commerce site build with Next.js 13.4+ and tailwind CSS
All the commits will be done only on main branch.
I will be updating the readme file as the site progresses.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
